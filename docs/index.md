# Welcome to the EQUIP Documentation

## Getting started

Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](./gettingstarted.md) page to get all set up.

## Usage

The general idea behind EQUIP is to first set up your classroom by selecting the demographics and discourse dimensions you want to track, input all of your students, then create observations and track students' contributions in the classroom by the discourse dimensions created earlier.
