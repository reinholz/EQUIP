# Groups

Groups are a currently WIP entity type which allows sharing of editing and viewing of personal content between users. Right now, the only instance of groups is the default example classroom that all users can view (but not edit). 

The creator of a group can add other users at different permissions levels to allow them to either view or edit all `environment`s that have been added to the group. They can also be allowed to manage the group with the `manage` access level, which allows them to add or remove other users, change their access levels (as long as the user they are changing has a lower access level), and remove shared `environment`s.

Any user can share or un-share their own `environment`s to a group at any time.

Once groups functionality is finalized, this page will be updated with more information.
