                EQUIP (<b>E</b>quity <b>QU</b>antified <b>I</b>n <b>P</b>articipation) was created in a joint and
                equal effort by Dr. Daniel Reinholz and Dr. Niral Shah. We believe that
                teaching is hard, complex work, and that teachers deserve support.
                Our vision is that EQUIP will empower teachers, professional developers,
                and researchers to build more equitable classrooms for more students.
                <b>If you care about equity in schools, EQUIP was made for you.</b>

                <p class="c--about-bio__title">Dr. Shah is a researcher, teacher educator, and former public school
                   teacher. His research focuses on understanding inequity at the classroom
                   level and supporting teachers to make their classrooms more equitable,
                   with an emphasis on racial equity and implicit bias. Dr. Shahâ€™s research
                   has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Spencer Foundation,
                   and the National Academy of Education.

            Dr. Shah holds a B.S. in Economics and a B.A.S. in Computer Science
            from the University of Pennsylvania, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Education
            from the University of California, Berkeley. Currently, Dr. Shah is an
            Assistant Professor in the Department of Teacher Education at Michigan
            State University. As a high school teacher, he taught math at a
            racially diverse high school in Northern California, and is originally
            from the Chicago area where he grew up a diehard Chicago Cubs fan.
