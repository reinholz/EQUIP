Actual participation is the actual number of times a discourse dimension occurs (e.g., the actual number of high-level questions asked by a teacher). Expected participation is the number of times we would expect a group of students to participate based on that group’s demographic representation in a particular classroom.</p>
                <p class="c--help-faq-customize__copy">Equity ratios can be greater than one, less than one, or equal to one. Overall, equity ratios help account for the raw numbers of students from different demographic groups in a given classroom.</p>
                <p class="c--help-faq-customize__copy">To illustrate how equity ratios are calculated and what they mean, imagine a classroom where 40% of students are women:</p>
